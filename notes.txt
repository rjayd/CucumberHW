what is step definition?
Step definition is the code implemented for the steps mentioned in feature file

Test runner
we use test runner to execute all features in multiple combinations

features = we define the path of our feature file here
glue = we define the path of our steps here
dryRun = when it is set to true, it stops the actual execution and scan all the steps
strict = true, it checks all the steps definition
monochrome = it removes all unreadable characters from the console output
tags = we can segregate scenario based on tags and can execute them accordingly

@RunWith - junit
@CucumberOptions - features, glue,dryRun, monochrome, strict

hooks - @Before - we use this to define pre conditions
        @After - we use this to define post conditions

What is the difference between hooks and background?
Background is feature file specific which will be limited to a feature
Hooks are applicable for all the scenarios available in features

Data driven test -
Background - in a specific feature file, if we have common steps for all the scenarios, we write them in feature file
Hooks is applicable to all the features whereas background is limited to one specific feature file

Scenario and Scenario Outline difference-
When we use examples table for data driven testing, we use scenario outline instead of scenario

Data table -

HW - User should be able to modify employee personal details

Driver's license number
License exp date
SSN
SIN
Gender
Marital Status
Nationality
DOB
Nickname
Smoker
Military Service

DataTable as list - when we don't provide headers in the table

excel reading example for adding the employees
plugins - "pretty" is responsible to print all the steps in the console
html plugin generates cucumber.html report in target folder
takeScreenshot Method - we use Scenario in the hooks that accepts array
    of byte that's why we changed takescreenshots method in common methods class
cucumber maven report- it generates json report in target under cucumber-html-report

mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @test"
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@test"
